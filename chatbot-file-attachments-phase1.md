# AI Chatbot File Attachment - Phase 1 Research Summary

Summary of the conversation so far:
- Assistant searched backend routes directory to locate chatbot.js and files.js for implementing phase 1 backend changes for file attachment functionality, confirming their presence alongside other route files (auth.js, completions.js, projects.js, users.js)

- Assistant examined chatbot.js, files.js, and File.js backend files to implement file attachment functionality for AI chatbot:
  - chatbot.js contains existing query handling with session management, error analysis, and response generation using GeminiService
  - files.js provides comprehensive file management endpoints (listing, content retrieval, search) with project access controls
  - File.js model includes file metadata (size, type, permissions) and content handling methods

- Key findings from backend inspection:
  - Existing /api/files endpoints can support file attachment requirements with minimal extension
  - Chatbot route structure allows adding attachment metadata to messages
  - File model contains necessary fields (size, type, content) for attachment validation
  - Established patterns for protected routes and project confinement can be reused

- Implementation can leverage:
  - Current validation middleware and error handling patterns
  - File content retrieval through existing GET /api/files/:id endpoint
  - Project access security checks from files.js middleware
  - WebSocket infrastructure for real-time updates

- File model inspection revealed relevant properties for attachment constraints:
  - Size tracking (bytes and character counts)
  - Type differentiation (file/folder)
  - Language detection from extensions
  - Content storage and versioning
  - Permission controls for access validation

- Assistant searched backend services to understand how to integrate file attachment context into Gemini model responses, focusing on geminiService.js and related files
- Found key implementation details in streamingCompletionService.js:
  - Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash model with specific configuration (temperature: 0.3, topK: 40, topP: 0.95, maxOutputTokens: 512)
  - generateCompletion method accepts prompt, language, and filename parameters
  - Includes request validation with supported languages list
  - Has mock mode when GEMINI_API_KEY not configured
- Examined test files showing direct Gemini API testing with different configurations and prompt engineering approaches
- Verified frontend streaming implementation in use-streaming-completions.ts handles both WebSocket and SSE connections with error handling
- Found documentation in STREAMING_COMPLETIONS.md detailing architecture, API endpoints, and configuration options for streaming completions

  - Gemini 1.5 Flash model configuration with API key validation and rate limiting
  - Core generateErrorSolution method accepting user query and context parameters
  - Query classification system (error_resolution, how_to, optimization etc.)
  - Context-aware prompt building with system prompts tailored to query types
  - Mock response fallback when API key not configured

- Examined ChatSession.js model revealing:
  - MongoDB schema for storing chat sessions with message history
  - Context field structure including project/language info and error details
  - Methods for message management, context updates, and session statistics
  - Support for metadata in messages that could store file attachments

- Analyzed geminiService.test.js showing:
  - Comprehensive test coverage for query classification and response generation
  - Mocking of Google Generative AI API for testing
  - Error handling scenarios including rate limit retries
  - Validation of project type and language detection logic

- Key findings support file attachment implementation:
  - GeminiService already accepts context parameter that could include file content
  - ChatSession model provides metadata storage for attachment references
  - Existing test patterns can be extended for attachment functionality
  - Current architecture supports context-aware responses with file content integration

- Assistant checked repository structure to identify appropriate locations for documentation and phase 1 implementation targets, finding:
  - Existing markdown files including STREAMING_COMPLETIONS.md and gemini-chatbot-implementation-plan.md
  - Backend and frontend directory structures with configuration files
  - Multiple planning documents (phases-plan.md, plan.md, terminal-strategy.md)

# CollabCode - 4 Phase Development Plan

This document restructures the original comprehensive plan into 4 focused development phases, alternating between backend and frontend development for optimal workflow.

## Phase 1: Backend Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Focus: Core Backend Infrastructure & Authentication**

### 1.1 Project Setup & Database
- [ ] Initialize Node.js/Express backend with JavaScript
- [ ] Set up MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- [ ] Configure environment variables and basic middleware
- [ ] Design and implement database schemas:
  - Users (id, email, password, name, timestamps)
  - Projects (id, name, description, owner_id, timestamps)
  - Files (id, name, content, project_id, timestamps)
- [ ] Set up Docker configuration for development

### 1.2 Authentication System
- [ ] Implement user registration/login endpoints
- [ ] Set up JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Create password hashing with bcrypt
- [ ] Build authentication middleware
- [ ] Add user profile management endpoints
- [ ] Implement logout and token refresh

### 1.3 Basic Project & File Management APIs
- [ ] Create CRUD operations for projects
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for files
- [ ] Add project ownership and basic permissions
- [ ] Create file tree structure endpoints
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and logging
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization

**Deliverables:** Fully functional backend API with authentication and basic project/file management

## Phase 2: Frontend Foundation (Weeks 3-5)
**Focus: React App Setup & User Interface**

### 2.1 Frontend Setup
- [ ] Initialize React 18 app with Vite
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS and component library
- [ ] Configure routing with React Router
- [ ] Set up state management (Zustand/Redux Toolkit)
- [ ] Create basic project structure and components

### 2.2 Authentication UI
- [ ] Build login/register forms with validation
- [ ] Create authentication context and protected routes
- [ ] Implement token storage and API integration
- [ ] Design responsive layout components
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

### 2.3 Project Management Interface
- [ ] Create project dashboard and listing
- [ ] Build project creation/editing forms
- [ ] Implement file tree component
- [ ] Add basic file management interface
- [ ] Create navigation and layout structure
- [ ] Implement responsive design patterns

**Deliverables:** Complete frontend application with authentication and project management UI

## Phase 3: Advanced Backend & Real-Time Infrastructure (Weeks 5-7)
**Focus: WebSocket Integration & Collaboration Backend**

### 3.1 Real-Time Infrastructure
- [ ] Install and configure Socket.io server
- [ ] Implement room-based collaboration system
- [ ] Create session management for collaborative editing
- [ ] Add user presence and connection tracking
- [ ] Implement basic real-time event handling

### 3.2 Collaboration Engine
- [ ] Research and implement Operational Transform (OT) or CRDT
- [ ] Create text operation types (insert, delete, retain)
- [ ] Build conflict resolution algorithms
- [ ] Implement operation queuing and synchronization
- [ ] Add real-time cursor and selection tracking

### 3.3 Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement auto-save functionality
- [ ] Create version control and history tracking
- [ ] Add file sharing and permissions system
- [ ] Implement Redis caching for sessions
- [ ] Create backup and recovery mechanisms

**Deliverables:** Real-time collaboration backend with operational transform and session management

## Phase 4: Advanced Frontend & Production Ready (Weeks 7-9)
**Focus: Monaco Editor Integration & Production Deployment**

### 4.1 Code Editor Integration
- [ ] Install and configure Monaco Editor
- [ ] Create editor component with language support
- [ ] Implement file tabs and editor management
- [ ] Add syntax highlighting and themes
- [ ] Create find/replace and code formatting

### 4.2 Real-Time Collaboration UI
- [ ] Integrate Socket.io client
- [ ] Implement real-time text synchronization with editor
- [ ] Add collaborative cursors and user presence
- [ ] Create real-time user list and chat
- [ ] Implement connection status and error handling

### 4.3 Production & Optimization
- [ ] Implement comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Optimize performance and bundle size
- [ ] Add security hardening and rate limiting
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline and Docker production config
- [ ] Create monitoring, logging, and error tracking
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

**Deliverables:** Complete production-ready collaborative code editor platform

## Development Strategy

### Backend-First Approach
- **Phases 1 & 3**: Focus on backend development
- **Phases 2 & 4**: Focus on frontend development
- This approach ensures solid API foundation before UI development

### Key Principles
1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase builds upon the previous
2. **Testing Integration**: Testing implemented throughout each phase
3. **Security First**: Security considerations in every phase
4. **Performance Awareness**: Optimization considerations from the start

### Success Criteria
- **Phase 1**: Backend API fully functional with Postman/API testing
- **Phase 2**: Complete frontend app with all basic features working
- **Phase 3**: Real-time collaboration working in backend
- **Phase 4**: Production-ready application with full feature set

## Technology Stack Summary

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express.js (JavaScript)
- MongoDB + Mongoose ODM
- Socket.io for real-time features
- JWT + bcrypt for authentication
- Redis for caching

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + JavaScript
- Vite build tool
- Tailwind CSS + Headless UI
- Monaco Editor
- Socket.io-client
- Zustand/Redux for state management

**Infrastructure:**
- Docker for containerization
- CI/CD pipeline
- Production deployment setup

This phased approach ensures systematic development with clear milestones and deliverables at each stage.
